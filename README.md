## Text Summarization using Pegasus

This is a project that utilizes Pegasus to perform text summarization. The aim of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for text summarization using advanced natural language processing techniques.

Introduction

Text summarization is the process of reducing a large amount of text to a shorter version while retaining the most important information. This project uses Pegasus, a pre-trained model for abstractive text summarization, to generate a summary of any given text input. Streamlit is used to create a web application that makes it easy for users to input text and view the summary output.
